Project title: Bayesian multilevel model of micro RNA levels in ovarian-cancer and healthy subjects


Objective:
Characterize the difference between the miRNA level and health status of the patient on the scale of the data variability in the context of their potential 
usefulness in diagnosis. 

We have analyzed a case-control observational data on expression profiling of 49 preselected miRNA-based ovarian cancer indicators in 119 controls and 59 patients.
A Bayesian multilevel model was used to characterize the effect of disease on miRNA levels controlling for differences in age and body weight. 

Conclusions:
The proposed model allowed us to describe the set of miRNA levels in patients and controls. Three highly correlated miRNAs: miR-101-3p, miR-142-5p, mi-148a-3p rank the highest with almost identical effect sizes that ranges from 0.45 to 1.0. For those miRNAs the credible interval for AUC ranged from 0.63 to 0.67 indicating their limited discrimination potential. A little benefit in adding information from other miRNAs was observed. There were several miRNAs in the dataset (mi-604, hsa-miR-221-5p) for which inferences were uncertain. For those miRNAs more experimental effort is needed to fully assess their effect in the context of new hits discovery and usefulness as disease indicators.
